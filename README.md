# MyReads Project

The goal of MyReads project is to create a bookshelf app that user is allowed to select and categorize books he have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that student will use to persist information as the user interact with the application.


## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## About

Initially, the providing code was a static example of the CSS and HTML markup that was used, but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Our job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code.


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
